About Surf Log
--------------

Surf Log is a MEAN stack web application that enables Bay Area surfers to associate accurate surf forecasts into their own personal surf catalogs.  Users are able to see graphs of the conditions they surf, average wave heights within the time frame they surfed, weather forecasts and so much more!
